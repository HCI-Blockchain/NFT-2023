@ZooToken - fractionalized metaverse real estate
@NIFTEXdotcom - fractionalized NFTs
@arkgalleryDAO - mini-DAOs formed to buy/sell a cryptopunk"

3728,2020-10-07 07:10:18+00:00,"""Zombie Beanie C64"" This is #cryptopunk #4513 using the Commodore 64 color palette. The CIEDE2000 algorithm was to approximate each pixel to a C64 color. The C64 only allows for 16 colors. The C64 used washed-out colors since these displayed well on TVs/CRTs of the day. https://t.co/GgA53x8nu8"
3729,2020-10-04 15:00:52+00:00,"Another super cool development by @arkgalleryDAO - Cryptopunk Bounties! Place an open bid on any punk with a specific attribute, or a general bid on any punk. Very cool. https://t.co/xPZTPntzJp"
3730,2020-10-04 14:20:20+00:00,"@99Kakistocratic Basically I'm at the point where I'm only going to sell a #cryptopunk if I absolutely need the money. They've clearly established themselves as the ultimate #NFT, and they're only going to keep increasing in value over time."

3732,2020-10-01 23:01:20+00:00,There are more  #cryptoPunk fakes on @rariblecom. Please be careful as they are also impersonating community members. If we could get some of the big sellers verified we could probably help slow the counterfeits. If you're in doubt please reach out to a community member for help. https://t.co/syRDvoRrs3
3733,2020-09-30 21:52:09+00:00,Tonight the big league of NFTs hit NFTfi in a big rush... A cryptopunk Ape recently sold for 140 ETH (50k USD) and this one has a gold chain! Wonder what offers it will attract. https://t.co/26xgx63WXF #NFTfi #DeFi #NFTs https://t.co/JT7zgrktoK
3734,2020-09-29 05:42:31+00:00,"In hindsight, YOLO'n on a #cryptopunk would have been safer and more responsible than going in on $EMN"
3735,2020-09-28 18:09:15+00:00,"#Cryptopunks are making history every day. 
More and more collectors are flocking in to own a #cryptopunk aka #nft origin.
Momentum is driving new developments. With @NIFTEXdotcom people can even buy shares of punks $COZOM $APE$ $ZOM19.
Chapeau, @larvalabs 👏"

3738,2020-09-27 14:09:26+00:00,The CryptoPunk floor just gets higher and higher 👀. I think every early adopter should have at least 1 as soon as they can afford it. CP’s paved the way and will always be a historic project. https://t.co/LEbiHEoXZt

3740,2020-09-27 03:50:54+00:00,"Everyone had the opportunity. I just sold this #cryptopunk for $1600 after buying it for $85. It sat on the market for nearly two years before I bought it. For two years, no one took a chance. I guarantee you there are other opportunities staring you in the face! https://t.co/9OnphoOF3D"
3741,2020-09-25 13:23:09+00:00,@pranksyNFT @NIFTEXdotcom @larvalabs a cryptopunk consists of 24x24pixel = 576pixel so it would be way cooler if you make 576 shards of a punk so that every shard replaces one Pixel 🥰
3742,2020-09-25 12:22:28+00:00,"I am potentially looking at selling my #cryptopunk collection as a whole. Approximately 150 punks, including 4x beanies (the rarest trait), several other sub-100 traits, and #1 Cryptopunk. Please DM if interested. Offers above 800 ETH will be considered."
3743,2020-09-25 04:48:49+00:00,The cheapest Cryptopunk is now 3E ($1000+). Wow. There was a time when we literally couldn’t give these things away. https://t.co/gvXqqmr5Qz
